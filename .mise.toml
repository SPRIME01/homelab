# # mise config files are hierarchical. mise will find all of the config files
# # in all parent directories and merge them together.
# # You might have a structure like:
#
# * ~/work/project/mise.toml   # a config file for a specific work project
# * ~/work/mise.toml           # a config file for projects related to work
# * ~/.config/mise/config.toml # the global config file
# * /etc/mise/config.toml      # the system config file
#
# # This setup allows you to define default versions and configuration across
# # all projects but override them for specific projects.
#

# [env]
